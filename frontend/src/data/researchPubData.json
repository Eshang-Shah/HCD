The cognitive flexibility associated with SLDs can manifest itself in noteworthy talents, which include a multi-sensory lens for creative and lateral thinking, resulting in out-of-the-box solutions for problems. The untapped potential of SLDs causes a high opportunity cost for the Nation’s progress. However, children with SLDs experience repeated failures and poor performance despite their continuous efforts and practice in learning. At the same time, worldwide, the condition will SLDs has been exacerbated due to the COVID-19 pandemic when education delivery shifted online. Thus, strengthening online education delivery will be important and impacting. However, research has indicated that educators might not always be aware of their students’ attentional focus, and this may be particularly true for novice teachers. The aim of this project is to develop an AI-empowered tool that will offer personalized, monitored, and evidence-based identification of attention levels among children with SLD. The project will first develop a multimodal dataset of audio-visual and physiological signals among 150 children with SLD to understand the attention and engagement of children with SLD during digital learning. It will further perform a systematic comparison of physiological, audio-visual, and eye-dilation signals for the attention monitoring of children with SLD to identify the valid indicators of attention. Based on these, the project will develop an AI-empowered system for real-time continuous monitoring of attention among children with SLD. Finally, the project will deploy and evaluate the efficacy of the developed AI-empowered system among 50 children with SLD and 25 typically developing children in naturalistic settings. Once validated the findings of this project can improve and monitor the attention of children with SLDs and can play a significant role in their inclusion during digital learning."
